/**
 * Controller ratings are publicly visible permission levels.
 * <p>
 * These levels can be roughly explained as follows (unofficial, see below):</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Ratings ({@link #S1} to {@link #C3}) are earned through common ATC training.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Instructor ratings ({@link #I} and {@link #I3}) require extra application at
 * local VACCs and are given based on controller rating as well as other
 * criteria. These ratings are only required as permission to train other
 * controllers.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Supervisors ({@link #SUP}) are providing help to all members and thus have
 * additional permissions on the network. They can also be called to intervene
 * on violation of rules or conflicts.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Administrators ({@link #ADM}) extend Supervisor permissions. In particular,
 * this level is assigned to all members of the Board of Governors and Founders
 * as per Code of Regulations.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Official documents describing some of these permissions on a global level
 * (VATSIM divisions, regions and VACCs may build on these policies):</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><a href="https://www.vatsim.net/documents/code-of-regulations">Code of
 * Regulations</a>, ยง1.01G</li>
 * <li><a href="https://www.vatsim.net/documents/code-of-conduct">Code of
 * Conduct</a></li>

 * Ratings Policy</a></li>
